# 1.3.0 The Ocarina update
- **Added**
    - Added a custom effect for every song of the Ocarina !
        - Song effects are kept secret... You need to play the song yourself to discover the behaviour !
        - All songs have a specific number of allowed usage per moons (some are 1 time use, some are 2). This can be disabled in the config but it's preferable to not modify this as it will become unbalanced
        - Thanks [Mrov](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/mrov/) for the lightning bolts code !
        - Thanks [A Glitched Npc](https://www.twitch.tv/a_glitched_npc) for testing and for effect ideas !
- **Fixed**
    - The Ocarina animation got a rework, hopefully it's working great now
    - Fixed Ocarina still playing audio if you cancel it by using the ship's terminal or when you drop it in the ship's cupboard

## 1.2.4
- **Fixed**
    - Fixed every damage and heal not working as intended if (somehow) you have more than max health

## 1.2.3
- **Updated**
    - Changed how The Master Sword reacts to unworthy players

## 1.2.2
- **Updated**
    - Added a new config "Ocarina unique songs", false by default. You can activate it to give every player a randomly selected song assigned to them (note that with this enabled, it's not possible to select other songs anymore)
- **Fixed**
    - I tried another fix for the Ocarina animation, but this time it's stronger
    - [lunxara](https://www.twitch.tv/lunxara) has reported that it's possible to use the Death Note on players that are no longer in the lobby, I didn't find a way to replicate this issue but I still modified the code to hopefully fix it

## 1.2.1
- **Updated**
    - The feature of the Boink added in the last update *"Have a small chance of launching you in the wrong direction"* has been reverted by default, but can be re-enabled with the newly added "Evil Boink" config
- **Fixed**
    - Fixed The Master Sword dropping all your items when you are unworthy
    - [a_glitched_npc](https://www.twitch.tv/a_glitched_npc) has reported that the Death Note UI is displayed for other players when the item is used by the host, I didn't find a way to replicate this issue but I still modified the code to hopefully fix it (but it's probably a mod incompatibility thing)
- **Information**
    - It appears that the jump boost effect given by Super Sneakers does not work when you have [BetterStamina](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FlipMods/BetterStamina/) installed, I'm still searching a way to fix that

# 1.2.0 Improvements
- **Added**
    - Imported from the original ChillaxScraps mod: Totem of Undying
- **Updated**
    - Totem of Undying
        - The code for this item is completly new, it now works exactly like in Minecraft
        - Multiple fix that I can't remember but trust me there is no issues ðŸ˜Ž
    - Boink
        - Now requires battery to be used
        - Have a small chance of launching you in the wrong direction
        - Audio is now properly assigned to the item
- **Fixed**
