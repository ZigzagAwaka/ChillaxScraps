### Notes
Each item has a low/medium spawn chance on all moons, you will not find them easily. This is to keep the game as vanilla as possible while adding some rare scraps to find if you are lucky !

*You can modify any spawn chance in the config file if you want to.*

### Feedback
You can post some suggestions or issues in the mod release page in the [modding discord](https://discord.com/invite/lcmod) or as a [github](https://github.com/ZigzagAwaka/ChillaxScraps) issue.

### ToDo
- Finish the transfer of all items in the original ChillaxScraps mod
- Improve the scraps and maybe add new items
