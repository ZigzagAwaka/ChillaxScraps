# ChillaxScraps

This mod is an updated version of the [original ChillaxScraps mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/CHILLAX/ChillaxSCRAPS/). BogBog, the original author, has stopped working on the mod and gave me permission to update and improve all the scraps.

This mod currently adds **12 scrap items** to the game but each original scraps are planed to be imported, improved and fixed.

You can check the Changelog file to see the list of improvements that I made... and let's just say that some are crazy ! üòè

Compatible with v64/v65/v66/v67/v68 of Lethal Company.

### Death Note
- This otherwordly notebook can be used to write a person's name and have *something* happen to them.
- The names of monsters can also be written in it.

### Ocarina
- This instrument will play emblematic tunes from Zelda !
- Playing this instrument might activate a special effect like opening a locked door, teleporting you somewhere, calling "Epona"...

### Uno Reverse Card
- The thing that turns your friends into your haters, can swap your position with that of a random player.
- You want to use it soooooo badly and especially when standing on a landmine.

### Totem of Undying
- This totem made of strange squares has the power to cheat death when you hold it in your hands, but it can only do so once.
- Beware to not fall into a pit with this in your hand, or else you're going to spend the rest of the day stuck at the bottom of it...!

### Custom effect items
- **Boink**, this red bird just wants to go *boink boink* with you ! Also, do you want free Robux?
- **Cup Noodle**, a tasty dish from Thailand, can be eaten to heal a small amount of health and stamina.
- **Emergency meeting**, this sussy red button will call your fellow crewmates once pressed, even if used with malicious intent...
- **Super Sneakers**, these strange shoes allow those who have them in their possession to jump higher than before. Perfect for avoiding weirdly obsessed cops.

### The Master Sword
- This legendary blade will decimate its owner's foes, but it can only be wielded by the chosen one.
- Are you really the one that is destined to lift this blade?

### Noisy items
- **Eevee** can be used to make some cute sounds!

### Notes
Each item has a low/medium spawn chance on all moons, you will not find them easily. This is to keep the game as vanilla as possible while adding some rare scraps to find if you are lucky !

*You can modify any spawn chance in the config file if you want to.*

### Compatible mods

- You should check [PremiumScraps](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Zigzag/PremiumScraps/), it pairs well with ChillaxScraps!
