# ChillaxScraps

This mod is an updated version of the [original ChillaxScraps mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/CHILLAX/ChillaxSCRAPS/). BogBog, the original author, has stopped working on the mod and gave me permission to update and improve all the scraps.

This mod currently adds **7 scrap items** to the game but each original scraps are planed to be imported, improved and fixed.

You can check the Changelog file to see the list of improvements that I made... and let's just say that some are crazy ! üòè

Compatible with v64 of Lethal Company.

### Notes
Each item has a low/medium spawn chance on all moons, you will not find them easily. This is to keep the game as vanilla as possible while adding some rare scraps to find if you are lucky !

*You can modify any spawn chance in the config file if you want to.*

### Feedback
You can post some suggestions or issues in the mod release page in the [modding discord](https://discord.com/invite/lcmod) or as a [github](https://github.com/ZigzagAwaka/ChillaxScraps) issue.

### ToDo
- Finish the transfer of all items in the original ChillaxScraps mod
