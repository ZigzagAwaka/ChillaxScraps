# ChillaxScraps

This mod is an updated version of the [original ChillaxScraps mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/CHILLAX/ChillaxSCRAPS/). BogBog, the original author, has stopped working on the mod and gave me permission to update and improve all the scraps.

This mod currently adds **16 scrap items** to the game, they were all imported, improved and fixed from the original mod!

You can check the Changelog file to see the list of improvements that I made... and let's just say that some are crazy ! 😏

Compatible with v73 of Lethal Company.

### Death Note
- This otherwordly notebook can be used to write a person's name and have *something* happen to them.
- The names of monsters can also be written in it.

- *The Death Note behaviour can be configured in the config file.*

### Ocarina
- This instrument will play emblematic tunes from Zelda !
- Playing this instrument might activate a special effect like opening a locked door, teleporting you somewhere, calling "Epona"...

- *For a list of all songs effects (spoiler warning!): [click here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SQ838HnpXKaiC1NUTi1dbDs0yOdbif-me_sHjmWocwY/edit?usp=sharing)*

### Uno Reverse Card
- The thing that turns your friends into your haters, can swap your position with that of a random player.
- You want to use it soooooo badly and especially when standing on a landmine.

*If you enjoy watching all your relationships crumble, you should definitely try the special DX version of the card if you happen to find it. What does this one do you ask? Try it for yourself and see how many of your friends decide to go to a therapist.*

### Totem of Undying
- This totem made of strange squares has the power to cheat death when you hold it in your hands, but it can only do so once.
- Beware to not fall into a pit with this in your hand, or else you're going to spend the rest of the day stuck at the bottom of it...!

### Dance Note
- The Death Note's groovy cousin, forces someone to dance.
- Going disco mode is highly recommended, else your innards are going to be the thing stepping on the dance floor...

### Custom effect items
- **Boink**, this red bird just wants to go *boink boink* with you ! Also, do you want free Robux?
- **Cup Noodle**, a tasty dish from Thailand, can be eaten to heal a small amount of health and stamina.
- **Emergency meeting**, this sussy red button will call your fellow crewmates once pressed, even if used with malicious intent...
- **Super Sneakers**, these strange shoes allow those who have them in their possession to jump higher than before. Perfect for avoiding weirdly obsessed cops.

### The Master Sword
- This legendary blade will decimate its owner's foes, but it can only be wielded by the chosen one.
- Are you really the one that is destined to lift this blade?

### Noisy items
- **Eevee** can be used to make some cute sounds!
- **Nokia**, this ancient phone will play even more ancient tunes, and you have absolutely no clue as to how it is still working after all these centuries.
- **Freddy Fazbear**, this strange bear can play some cute sounds when used... but he can get a bit quirky, and not just at night.

### Classic items
- Scraps with no special effects, but they come with custom audio or color variations.

### Notes
Each item has a low/medium spawn chance on all moons, you will not find them easily. This is to keep the game as vanilla as possible while adding some rare scraps to find if you are lucky !

*You can modify any spawn chance in the config file if you want to.*

### Compatible mods
